	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the efficient of an algorithm by describing how the number of operations grows with the input size, typically using Big-O notation. Common complexities include 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) for constant time, 
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(logn) for logarithmic time, 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) for linear time, and 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn) for linearithmic time, among others. Efficient algorithms, such as those with 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) or 
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(logn), scale well with larger datasets, saving time and computational resources. To ensure efficiency, use appropriate data structures, optimize loops, and apply techniques like divide-and-conquer or caching. Understanding time complexity helps in designing scalable and practical solutions.</p>
	<p>When an algorithm has a <b>Space Complexity</b> of 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n), it means the additional memory usage grows linearly with the input size 
𝑛
n. For example, creating a new array to store results or using a recursive algorithm with 
𝑛
n levels of recursion would both have 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) space complexity.<p>
