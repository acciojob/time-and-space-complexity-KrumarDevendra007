	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the efficient of an algorithm by describing how the number of operations grows with the input size, typically using Big-O notation. Common complexities include 
O(1) for constant time, O(logn) for logarithmic time, O(n) for linear time, and 
O(nlogn) for linearithmic time, among others. Efficient algorithms, such as those with 
O(n) O(logn), scale well with larger datasets, saving time and computational resources. To ensure efficiency, use appropriate data structures, optimize loops, and apply techniques like divide-and-conquer or caching. Understanding time complexity helps in designing scalable and practical solutions.</p>
<p>When an algorithm has a <b>Space Complexity</b> of 
O(n), it means the additional memory usage grows linearly with the input size 
n. For example, creating a new array to store results or using a recursive algorithm with 
n levels of recursion would both have 
O(n) space complexity.</p>
